# Internet-Usage-Gender-Equality-Data


**Data Table**

The study design called for sampling 500 respondents per country within each wave, equally balanced between 250 teens (ages 13-17) and 250 adults (ages 18-74). Additional adult age quotas were set to ensure the respondent mix reflected the internet user population within the country.  Quotas were also set to ensure  representation of both males and females within each age group.

All countries included in the final dataset were surveyed across at least four waves, ensuring at least 2,000 total respondents from each geo (hence at least 1,000 teen and adult respondents).

The dataset includes 120 variables including basic respondent demographics (age, gender, country) along with key questions repeated across multiple waves. Note that select countries were not represented across all 6 waves, and items changed slightly over time, so not every response item is found in all 6 waves.

Key topics/variables in the dataset include:

•	**Online Risks Encountered** (Q2A_Doxing to Q2U_unwanted sexual attention) Twenty one risk items asking respondents whether they encountered specific types of internet incivility.

•	**Risk Sources** (Q2ar1_risk source to Q2axnone) Who were the sources of uncivil behavior that respondents encountered 

•	**Pain experienced** (Q5_1A_pain to Q5_1U) How much pain was caused by any specific risks respondents experienced in Q2. Asked for up to 5 randomly selected risks a given user experienced

•	**MaxPain** What was the highest level of pain/discomfort experienced from any online risk

•	**Recency of risk** (Q6A_most_recent to Q6U) When was the last time the risk was experienced

•	**Consequences of risks** (Q9r2_consiquences to Q9r25) What consequences were experienced as a result of online incivility

•	**Actions taken in response to online risks** (Q12r1_actions_take to Q12r22) 

•	**WW_Weight** a weighting variable which exactly balances out males and females within adult and teen quotas in each country. Useful for comparisons between groups or waves when the unweighted number of males vs females may be different.
